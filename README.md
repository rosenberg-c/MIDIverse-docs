## Features  

### Channel Mapper Utility  

- **Channel Selection**: Choose an input channel and assign it to an output channel.  
- **Highlighting**: Active channels are highlighted, with a distinct background color if the input differs from the output.  
- **Routing**: Configure specific input-output mappings (e.g., `[3:8]` for routing channel 3 to channel 8).  
- **Omni Mode**: Route all incoming channels to a single output channel.  
- **Enable/Disable All**: Quickly reset all channels to their default state.  

### Zone Mapper Utility  

- **Listening Channel**: Select a channel to listen to incoming MIDI events.  
- **Delimiters**: Use up to four delimiters to split notes into distinct routing zones.  
- **Zone Mapping**: Notes below the first delimiter return to the listening channel, while notes above are routed to specified output channels.  
- **Five Zones**: Create up to five note routing zones for granular control.  

### Settings  

- **MIDI Connections**: Select input and output devices and send test notes.  
- **Virtual Devices**: Create or destroy two virtual MIDI devices, with an option to auto-create them on app start.  
- **Custom Options**: Tailor settings to your workflow for maximum efficiency.
